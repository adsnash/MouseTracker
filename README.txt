This is a Python program that tracks the coordinates and RGB value of the mouse. I claim no credit for this script; I am putting it up because I've found it very useful. All credit for this program belongs to Al Sweigart and can be found in his online book automatetheboringstuff.com in Chapter 18. 

Please note: this program only works from the command line and will not work properly in IDLE.
